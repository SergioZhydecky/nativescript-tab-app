You can customise tab button

NativeScript TabView does not allow you to customize tab button. This solution allows you to do that.

With this solution you will be able to style/place tab buttons as you need and have multiple page-router-outlets.


In v2.0
- Multiple page-router-outlets added as nested page which is lazy loadded.
- Added lazy loaded pages to multiple page-router-outlets
